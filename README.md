### 0_ Literature review
Contains a pdf of the literature review for this project.
### 1_ Sofa installation
Contains a pdf with a precise description of how to install SOFA and the plugins that I used.
### 2_ Simulation models
Contains code and documentation that explains what I did to create the virtual models.
### 3_ Medical task (Work in progress)
Contains code to simulate the medical tasks. Documentation will be added later.
### 4_ GUI
Contains code for two simple GUIs that runs the simulations. The first one is to define the path to the sofa files. The Submit button of this GUI opens the second one, which allows the user to choose the parameters of the simulation and to decide if they want to visualize the plots of their simulation.
