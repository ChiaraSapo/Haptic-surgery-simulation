# Surgery simulation on SOFA Framework
This repository contains:
- A folder (Medical Simulations) with the scripts for the prototypes of multiple haptic training surgery tasks to be performed on the SOFA Framework Open Source Software and the Geomagic Touch haptic device. The tasks are the following:
  - a suture training task with one device
  - a suture training task with two devices
  - an incision training task
  - a (more generic) dexterity task
- A folder (GUIs) with the scripts for three simple GUIs that ease the usability of my simulations, allowing to choose the type of task, the number of haptic devices, etc.
- A tutorial for the installation from sources of the SOFA Framework Software v20.12.02, the useful plugins and the Geomagic Touch drivers
